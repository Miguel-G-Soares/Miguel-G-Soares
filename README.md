<h1>Hey, I'm Miguel! </h1>

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. As a Data Scientist with an engineering background, I focus on generating insights and developing models that provide the information needed to make data-driven decisions.

I have a growing portfolio of projects demonstrating my expertise in EDA and ML modelling, featuring R, Python, and SQL queries for data manipulation, Tableau/Seaborn/Matplotib visualisations, and multiple supervised and unsupervised models, illustrating my passion for turning complex data¬†into relevant insights.

Feel free to explore my repositories and contact me if you have any questions!

<h2>üìï Guides</h2>

### [Journey into Data Science](https://github.com/Miguel-G-Soares/Journey-into-Data-Science)
**Description:**
Detailed, easy-to-understand guide documenting my learning, covering the fundamental theory of data science, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistics, regression and machine learning.

**Objective:** Create a living-document thatsimplifies as much as possible complex concepts with real-world examples, making it a compendium of information for beginners getting into the field while maintaining completeness.

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Projects:</h2>

### [Employee Turnover Prediction at Salifort Motors](https://github.com/Miguel-G-Soares/Employee-Turnover-ML-Model)

*( Python - Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting )*

**Description:**
The HR department of Salifort Motors is concerned about employee turnover,and wants to understand what features contribute most to emloyee turnover rates to help identify employees at risk of leaving.

**Objective:**
Preform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on employee data to identify key factors that contribute to employee turnover.
Create various machine learning models to predict whom is most at risk.

### [Automated Detection of Claims in TikTok Content](https://github.com/Miguel-G-Soares/Automated-Detection-of-Claims-in-TikTok-Videos)

*( Python - NPL, ML modelling )*

**Description:**
TikTok's moderation team wants to streamline the process of reviewing content that has been flagged by developing a ML model to pre-process content, allowing them to prioritizeg user reports more effectively

**Objective:**
Classify videos into either opinion-based or claim-based utilizing the data gathered.

### [Cyclistic - Bicycle Sharing, Chicago](https://github.com/Miguel-G-Soares/Cyclistic-Analysis)

*( SQL, R , Python )*

**Description:**
A bike sharing company in Chicago aims to move away from their current strategy and establishes a new goal, converting their casual pay-per-ride customers into annual membership subscribers.

**Objective:**
Preform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the customer base & consumer habits of casual riders vs annual membership users.
Identify key differences and potential opportunities to influence customers into upgrading their subscription plan.
